"""Codegen clean composed — constraint stripping state machine.

CC=4+. Imports from simple and primitive within this module.

The constraint duplication bug occurs because datamodel-code-generator copies
pattern/min_length/max_length constraints from a RootModel's root field onto
every Field that references that RootModel type. At runtime, Pydantic applies
both the RootModel's constraints (correct) and the Field's constraints
(duplicate), causing TypeError when the constraint types conflict. This
transform removes the Field-level duplicates.
