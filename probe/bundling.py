"""Bundling probe — the canonical unmatched-count test.

NOT PRODUCTION CODE. This script is a critical iteration tool, exempt
from gleipnir guardrails while the data shapes and program architecture
are being decided. Once those decisions are made, the logic here will
be absorbed into the real pipeline (probably as a stage-2 bundler).
Until then, every schema rename / refactor should re-run this probe
to see the effect on the unmatched count.

History: this is Generation 4 of the bundling test, originally written
inline as `python -c "..."` in an earlier session. The inline form made
the iterations untraceable — every rename/recount pair lived only in
the session log. This file is the persistent home so we keep a shared
record of what the probe does and what each run measures.

What it measures:
  Given the four-axis inputs loaded through the gates, and given the
  existing `sort_into_slots` stage-1 classifier, count how many
  structure and display fields land in a slot that NONE of:
    - a data field in that slot (Pass 1 trunk-prefix match), or
    - a content field in that slot (Pass 2 trunk-prefix match, either
      direction: content.startswith(field) or field.startswith(content))
  matches. Every unmatched field is a schema naming issue or an
  intentional section-level control that doesn't bundle with anything.

Driving the count down:
  - Rename offending fields so their trunk matches an existing data or
    content trunk.
  - Prefix true preprocessing fields with `pre_` so the slot sorter
    filters them out entirely (they never enter the bundling pipeline).

How to run:
  uv run python probe/bundling.py

  Default inputs are agent-builder; override with arguments if needed.

Runnable without PYTHONPATH; the sys.path setup at the top points at
the local src/ and the gate lib dir.
