# CONTEXT_MAP — Galdr

## Purpose

Galdr is the composition engine — the final stage of the agent pipeline (Verdandi → Draupnir → Nornir → Regin → **Galdr**): it combines one gate-validated agent data model with three independently swappable control surfaces (structure, content, display) into deployable agent prompts.

## Orientation gate — read these, in this order, to be oriented

> Start with `context/`. It answers *why this system exists* — which is the one thing that
> cannot be recovered from the tree, and the thing every previous session got wrong by
> inferring it from the structure. Read the map, then the element document for wherever you
> are working. Everything after it will land differently.

1. `context/AGENT_BUILD_SYSTEM.md` — the pipeline-wide map: what the whole system is for, why determinism is the goal, and the double gate that makes LLM-written transformation safe. Wikilinked to the five element documents; follow them as needed.
2. `context/GALDR_ELEMENT.md` — Galdr itself: the four axes, the invariance test that decides where a field belongs, how names carry the mechanism, and **what of the engine actually exists today** (stage 1; stages 2–4 are not built).
3. `context/GALDR_CHALLENGES.md` — volatile companion. Its C, D and E sections are *requirements for the unbuilt waist*, not a bug list; A, B, F and G are live. Its own header says how to read it — do not skip that.
4. `redesign/FOUR_AXIS_SPEC.md` — the four-axis model and the benchmarking matrix: what each axis contains, and why entangling any two of them destroys the product.
5. `redesign/COMPOSITION_ENGINE_DESIGN.md` — the generic engine: one `compose_section()` for all sections, buffer slots, data gates, zero per-section code.
6. `redesign/01_PROCESSING_FLOW.md` — the four-stage pipeline (chunk, gather, resolve+render, buffer) and why each stage shrinks the problem.
7. `redesign/TOML_ARCHITECTURE.md` — the naming law: positional suffixes, field interface patterns, threshold types, section categories. The engine reads names mechanically; this doc is the authority on what names mean.
> The next four are read by you, personally, in this context — never delegated
> to a subagent, never absorbed via a summary.

8. `WHY_THIS_FEELS_WRONG.md` — the frame: what this environment is, and why it
   will feel over-constrained until you understand it
9. `EVERY_CHECK_IS_A_PROXY.md` — why the feedback steers where it steers; what
   each constraint is a proxy for. Read before doc 10, so the level system reads
   as engineering rather than as limits.
10. `THE_LEVEL_SYSTEM.md` — zones, levels, and the decision procedure for where
   every piece of code lives. Prerequisite to writing anything.
11. `HOW_DATA_ENTERS.md` — the boundary: how external data becomes typed, and
   why unknown data never gets in. Prerequisite to reading any file.

**Proof:** before writing anything: (a) state three project-specific constraints
that diverge from how you'd normally do this work, with reasons; (b) from the
four environment docs, state the one item you found most interesting, the one
that most surprised you, and the one you are most eager to put into practice —
chosen by you, in your own words. Generic acknowledgment means you are not
oriented — go back and read.
